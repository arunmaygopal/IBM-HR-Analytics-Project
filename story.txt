 IBM HR Employee Attrition Analysis 

      The overall attrition rate in the company is 16.1%, with 237 out of 1,470 employees having left the organization. This suggests a moderately high turnover that warrants further investigation into root causes.
It would be beneficial to introduce structured exit interviews to gain clarity on recurring factors that drive employees to leave. When analyzing attrition by gender,
it was found that 17% of male employees left the company compared to 14.8% of female employees. This slight difference could be influenced by job roles or departmental
assignments and may indicate the need to explore male-dominated roles or departments for workplace dissatisfaction.

      Looking at age, attrition is highest among the youngest employees. The 18–20 age group had a staggering 57% attrition rate, while the 40–50 age group had the
lowest at just 9%. Younger employees may be leaving due to lack of engagement, unclear career growth, or better opportunities elsewhere. Enhanced onboarding, mentorship,
and early-career development programs could help reduce this trend. 

      Among departments, Research & Development saw the largest number of employees leaving, with 133 departures, followed by Sales with 92, and Human Resources with 12.
 While this could be due to the sheer size of the R&D department, it also raises questions about job satisfaction, leadership, or career progression in those roles. 
 A department-level satisfaction survey might provide actionable insights.

      A clear link was observed between monthly income and attrition. Employees earning less than $5,000 per month made up the majority of those who left, totaling 163
out of 237. Meanwhile, attrition significantly dropped in higher salary brackets, with only 5 employees leaving in the $15,000–$20,000 range. This indicates that
lower compensation is a strong driver of attrition, suggesting that salary reviews and fair pay structures could help retain employees. A similar trend is seen with
salary hike percentages, where most employees who left had received only a 10–15% hike, while attrition declined as the hike percentage increased. This supports the idea that competitive and performance-based salary increments are essential for retention.

      Educational background also appears to have a relationship with attrition. Among those who left, 89 had a Life Sciences degree, 63 came from Medical fields, and 
35 had a Marketing background. However, since this reflects the number of people rather than percentages, it's important to normalize these findings by educational group
size before concluding. Further analysis is required to understand if education field impacts retention. 

      The data also shows that employees with no stock options (Level 0) made up the majority of those who left, at 154 employees, while only 15 employees with Level 3
stock options left. This suggests that offering higher-level stock options can increase employee loyalty and reduce attrition.
